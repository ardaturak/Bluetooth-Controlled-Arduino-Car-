# Bluetooth-Controlled-Arduino-Car-

This repository contains the code for a Bluetooth-controlled Arduino car project. The project is implemented using an Arduino UNO, HC-05 Bluetooth module, Motor Driver L298, and Gear Motors. The purpose of the project is to create a remote-controlled car with wireless communication capabilities.

## Key Features:

#### Wireless Control: 
Utilizes the HC-05 Bluetooth module for seamless wireless communication between the Arduino UNO and a controlling device.
#### Motor Control: 
The movement of the car is managed by the Motor Driver L298, providing precise control over the gear motors.
#### Arduino UNO: 
Serves as the brain of the system, executing the code to interpret Bluetooth signals and control the motors accordingly.

## Repository Contents:

#### Arduino Code: 
The main logic and functionality of the Bluetooth-controlled car are implemented in the Arduino code provided in this repository.
